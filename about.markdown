I'm a recent graduate from Purdue, but I went to two different universities before I transfered to Purdue in my Junior year. I went to Columbus State University in Columbus Georgia as a freshman, and the University of Louisville as a sophomore.

When I'm not coding, I like to:

- Drive
- Skateboard
- Listen to drum and bass music
- Drink coffee
- Watch YouTube documentaries and video essays
- Think of other things that I want to code
